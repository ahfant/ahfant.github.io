While searching for a better alternative to Octopress (which unfortunately did not work out too well for me), I ended up reading more about static web hosting and stumbled upon [Netlify][netlify].

With a few clicks, I could link my Netlify account to my GitHub repository. Plus it supports continuous integration. Hence, this site is now dual-hosted on <https://ahfant.netlify.com>. 

Best of all, I only need to maintain one single repository.
